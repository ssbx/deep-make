This script search for a makefile in parent directories until it reaches
SRC_ROOT. We can then call make deep inside a project directories.

- The script must reside in $HOME/bin
- Edit SRC_ROOT variable to fit your env, default is $HOME/src
- Call to system make are made with a PATH variable where $HOME/bin is the
  last entry (be aware of)
- Will call system make if any of -C|-f|--directory=*|--file=*|--makefile=*
  arguments are present
